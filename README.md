# Forecasting-and-Predicting-the-Furniture-Sales-using-ARIMA
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. This dataset consists of daily sales data of various products at a superstore. We will need to apply Time Series (ARIMA) to build model to predict and forecast the sales of furniture for the next one year i.e. predict future values based on previously observed values. We have a 4-year furniture sales data.
We remove unwanted columns that is not needed and check missing values. Aggregate sales data by date and finally index it with the time series data.
We check the stationarity of the data and decide the next step to be taken. Also decompose the data for further clarification and apply the time series model on the data.
We perform parameter selection to find optimal set of parameters that yields the best performance for the model.
We compare predicted value to the real values and set the forecast from the start to the end of the data.
